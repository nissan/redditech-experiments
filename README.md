# Redditech Experiments

The goal of this repository is to contain half-baked ideas, experiments and other random stuff I find myself hacking at any given time. It may form a bigger project at some point, or it may fizzle and die right here. But at least it's here if someone sees use for it, take it, learn from it, improve it, pay it forward and share the learnings back with our community.
